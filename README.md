# AA-Metal-and-Milk-Textures

  Small custom retexture mod for Alpha Animals with a stack-size dependent Skymetal multi-graphic and improved textures for Gow Milk and Blue Milk.
  
  The base images for these updated textures came from an old compilation by Cody Spring and Drgn! Netrve which has mostly been made obsolete by newer mods.
  
  These specific retextures haven't been done by anyone else though, so I revived and updated this small part of the mod for use with Alpha Animals.
